# Tutorial
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BOTH PYTHON AND PYGAME INSTALLED!

To run the program, double click the "init" file. Make sure python is installed.

To move, use the left and right arrow keys.

To shoot, press space.

To switch weapons, press e.

To buy weapons and repairs, press s. To exit that screen, press s again. It
will pause the game, so use that as a pause window if you need to
pause the game.

Don't die.

To quit, press escape.

If you find the sound effects obnoxious or want to mess with the config
settings, open the config.py file in TextEdit and follow the instructions
in the file.

Oh yeah, and if you do die and defy my instructions,
press r to play again.
